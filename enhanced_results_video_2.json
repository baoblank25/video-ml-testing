    "description": "This time, I have a 15-inch Dell XPS to repair and using my USB-C power meter, I tried the two ports on one side and saw that it was stuck at 5 volts. This meant that the laptop was not negotiating the 20 volts it needed to power on. When I checked the other side, 20 volts was achieved, but the laptop was still dead. This pointed to a motherboard issue.\n\nUpon opening the bottom of the laptop, I found the fan stuffed with fluff and quite a bit of water damage. The smell of burnt electronics and a burnt chip explained why the laptop was not working.\n\nNot one to back out of a challenge, I removed the motherboard and took a look under the microscope. The USB-C power delivery chip connected to these ports was burnt. Replacing a burnt BGA chip is not a fun task, but I removed the bad chip, repaired the damaged pads as much as I could, and installed a new chip. After cleaning the fans and the water damage, I reassembled the laptop to test it.\n\nI fixed the motherboard, and if you need your repaired, fill out a service request form at partspeople.com",
